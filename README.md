# codility-lessons-java

In this project I will be posting my Java solutions for [Codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/) lessons.

For the solutions that I got inspired by other sources, I added credits and the urls to the respective sources, in addition to my own refactoring and explanations.

## Project structure
The project is structured in the same format as the lectures in Codility website in order to be
easy to follow and locate a specific solution.

Everything is located under the main package ``com.kristijorgji.codility.lessons`` as follows:
    
        _5_prefixSums
            CountDiv
            MinAvgTwoSlice
        _[lessonNumber]_[lessonName]
            [ExerciseName].java
            ...

The same structure is followed also for the respective unit tests, under the folder tests.

Enjoy, happy learning ;)
